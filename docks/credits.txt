I'd like to thank the folowing people for helping me bring my game into existence.
A huge thanks goes out to my friend and co developer Kitsune for his briliont ideas and amence insperation to keep this game going. You never ran out of ideas to suggest and develop wonderful things. Without you, I wouldn't of been able to figure out what else I could've possibley implemented to make this game entertain and impress others, so thanks again for that.
A big thanks goes out to my friend Masonasons for providing me the improved version of dlg and m_pro. Without those, my game would've kept freezing do to music and sound issues. You also helped me out with lots of code optimizations along the way, and I'm very thankfull for that as well.
Thanks goes to Hary MK for helping me add and fix some of the functions in the regular game modes. I loved what you did when helping me add the ability to play a custom game mode with any enemy you wanted. It turns out that there was a function that you could use to find a sertain string in a string aray. I never knew that string.find was an actual function untill now, so thanks so much for that.
Thanks goes to Parker Watson  for the huge help with the game. Mainly fixing character creation, weapon parsing, map making, and lot's of other small things along the way. I really apprishiated all of your wonderful support. You're awsome!
Last but not least, thanks goes out to all of the other Beta testers who played my game. All of your feadbacks were highly valued and welcomed. This game would've never been what it is today if it weren't for your guys support and suggestions.
